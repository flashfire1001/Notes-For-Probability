    "The law of large numbers describes the result of performing the same experiment a large number of times. Let $X_1,X_2, \\ldots ,X_n$ be a set of uncorrelated random variables, each with a finite mean of $\\mu$. Let $S_n$ represent the sum of these random variables: $S_n=X_1+X_2+...+X_n$. The law of large numbers states that $P\\left\\{\\Big|\\frac{S_n}{n}-\\mu\\Big|\\ge\\delta\\right\\}\\le\\frac{C}{n\\delta^2}\\to0$ as $n\\to\\infty$. Put another way this simply states that the sum of the RVs divided by n converges in some sense to the mean ($\\frac{S_n}{n}\\to\\mu$). A proof of this is given in the ECE 313 textbook, using a bounded variance assumption and the Chebychev inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "To observe this behavior by simulation, let's look at the Poisson distribution. A Poisson RV has a single parameter $\\lambda$ which represents the mean number of occurances or counts, such as the mean number of hits your Youtube video gets in a day.  Then the probability that your video gets $i$ hits in one day is given by the pmf: $p(i)=\\frac{\\lambda^ie^{-\\lambda}}{i!}$. So what if you totalled the number of hits you received each day for a week, month, or year and divided by that many days? The law of large numbers asserts that as $n$ gets large this should go to the mean $\\lambda$. Below, we create a Poisson distribution where $\\lambda=5$ hits per day. We retrieve a random variate each day and model the law of large numbers over time. Try running the cell multiple times and see how much variation there is for different runs."
